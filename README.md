# Arduino-RFID-Reader
I created a RFID door lock with an Arduino. This is the source code for that. It is pretty documented. All that is needed is the rfid-master library that is included. The RFID card code can be changed on line 22. This code is meant to power a relay for 2 seconds, this disengages a door latch.
